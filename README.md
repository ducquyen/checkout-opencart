**Nocks payment gateway for Opencart 2 and 3**

## Installation

The Nocks Opencart plugin is installed by downloading the correct zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/nocksapp/checkout-opencart/releases) tab.
For Opencart versions 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 download "nocks-opencart-2.0.ocmod.zip", for Opencart versions 2.3 and up (including Opencart 3.*) download "nocks-opencart-2.3.ocmod.zip".

After downloading the zip go to the Opencart adminpanel and open the "extensions installer", there upload the just downloaded zip file.

When the zip is uploaded successfully, the Nocks paymentmethod should be visible in the Opencart Payments overview.
